## ðŸŽ® How to Play

> **Awaking** is a 5-minute minimalist experience where you play as a character who must choose between breaking the current (helping others break free from addiction) or going with the flow (accepting the status quo). Your decisions determine which of the two alternate endings you'll reach, reflecting the game jam's *downstream* theme through simple yet meaningful narrative.

- [W/A/S/D] -> To move in four directions
-    [E]    -> To interact with an NPC when the indicator above and them appears
-   [ESC]   -> To open settings inside the game
-   [Mouse] -> Only for the main menu and settings

### Objective  

**Two bars track your struggle in the bottom-left corner:**  
- **Influence (Blue)**: Your power to change minds  
- **Energy (Golden)**: The stamina to keep fighting  

The city flows like a river of glowing screens. You move against the current, offering weathered books to strangers drowning in digital light. Some shrug you offâ€”their rejection drains your resolve. Others hesitate, and in that moment, you pour your energy into persuasion. Even standing still has consequences; the tide erodes your will differently when you choose not to act.  

Three types of people drift through this neon stream: the willing, the resistant, and those too far gone. Learn their rhythmsâ€”your success depends on reading the subtle currents in their eyes.  

> [!TIP]
> *(Mechanically: Each NPC interaction dynamically affects your Influence and Energy bars.
> Manage both resources carefully to reach the ending you desire.)*
